A Generic Systick Timer Driver that's compitable with any ARM Cortex M4, M3
Functions:-
1- void SysTick_Init(uint16 a_TimeInMilliSeconds);
2- void SysTick_DeInit(void);
3- void SysTick_Start(void);
4- void SysTick_Stop(void);
5- void SysTick_StartBusyWait(uint16 a_TimeInMilliSeconds);
6- extern void SysTick_Handler(void);
7- extern void SysTick_SetCallBack(volatile void (*Ptr2Func) (void));
*** Important ***
in order to use the systick handler and interrupts, the macro "Enable_Execptions();" must be called
which is included in the "NVIC.h" file in the NVIC Driver.
each function has it's descriptions.
